# Handwritten Letter Recognition Project

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for recognizing handwritten letters. The primary goal is to create a system that accurately identifies and classifies letters from input images of handwritten text.

## Introduction

Handwritten letter recognition is a challenging task that involves the use of deep learning techniques to accurately identify individual letters in handwritten text. This project employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to achieve high accuracy in recognizing letters from diverse handwriting styles.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.10.1
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
We collected a dataset by asking individuals to write letters of the Turkish alphabet. Participants provided their written letters along with signatures to grant permission for data usage. The dataset includes images of handwritten letters and corresponding signature images.

### Data Collection Process
Letter Writing: Participants were requested to write letters of the Turkish alphabet on paper.

Permission Signatures: Participants provided their signatures as a form of consent for using their data in our project.

Image Acquisition: We captured images of the handwritten letters and signatures using 3 cameras.

### Dataset Organization

The dataset is organized into the following structure:
